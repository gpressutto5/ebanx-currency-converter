## Customizing

You can make your own design and use this plugin in your theme! Just make sure you add the following attributes to the elements you want to use as currency switch:

* `class`: `ebanx-currency-converter--flag-link`
This class has no styling. It is used for javescript to find the flag elements.
* `data-currency`: `USD`, `EUR`, `BRL`, `MXN`, `COL`, `CLP` or `PEN`
The currency this link switches to.

Example:
```html
<a href="#" class="ebanx-currency-converter--flag-link" data-currency="BRL">Real</a>
<a href="#" class="ebanx-currency-converter--flag-link" data-currency="USD">Dollar</a>
```

Also, for styling purposes, the selected currency will automatically get the class `active`.
